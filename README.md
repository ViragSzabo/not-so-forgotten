# 🕯️ Not-So-Forgotten Cemetery

_A gothic autumn radio that whispers the memories of the not-so-forgotten._

---

## 🍁 Overview

**Not-So-Forgotten Cemetery** is a C# .NET MAUI application that blends technical skills with poetic storytelling. It is set in a misty digital graveyard with a **radio station** and a **memory keeper** — where every tombstone holds a story, and every whisper is a fragment of someone never forgotten.
The project demonstrates **multi-threading**, **async/await**, and **SQLite database operations** in a visually atmospheric interface.

_“Some memories never rest — they hum, they whisper, they wait.”_

## 🧩 Features

- **🎙️ Radio Station** – Background threads simulate music and message broadcasts, inspired by the spirits of the town.
- **🪦 Digital Cemetery** – Each grave represents a stored memory in a local SQLite database.
- **🌫️ Memory Whispers** – Threads periodically reveal a random memory as a ghostly “whisper” on screen.
- **🕰️ Autumn Clockwork** – A real-time clock marks the passage of time, or counts down to symbolic dates.
- **💾 Async Operations** – SQLite CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) executed asynchronously.
- **🎨 Atmospheric UI** – Gothic visuals, candle animations, and misty effects crafted for the autumn aesthetic.
